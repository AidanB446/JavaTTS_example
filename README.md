TTS for java example. Uses he freetts-1.2.2 library. I struggled finding a good example for TTS, I searched for like 3 days, but then found one. Hope this helps someone with the same problem as I had.

Download the freetts library as a zip folder here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetts/files/FreeTTS/FreeTTS%201.2.2/
